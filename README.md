# Personal AutoHotkey Scripts Collection

This repository contains my personal collection of AutoHotkey scripts that I use to enhance productivity and automate repetitive tasks on Windows.

## Overview

AutoHotkey is a free, open-source scripting language for Windows that allows users to automate repetitive tasks, create hotkeys, and build macros.

## Installation

1. Download and install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sanjeeviraju/AutoHotkeys
   ```
3. Double-click on any `Hotkeys.ahk` file to run it, or add the script 'Startup.ahk' to your Windows startup folder to run them automatically

## Usage

Each script contains documentation at the beginning explaining its purpose and any hotkeys or functionality it provides.

## Customization

Feel free to modify any script to suit your needs. Most scripts have configuration variables at the top that can be adjusted.
